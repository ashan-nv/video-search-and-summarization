# Video QnA using a VLM endpoint

Answer a fresh visual question about a video by calling an OpenAI-compatible
**VLM `chat/completions` endpoint directly** — obtain the video, pick the live VLM
endpoint/model, send the user's question with the video, and return the answer.
**This skill does not call** `POST /generate` on the VSS agent. The **only hard
requirement is a reachable, OpenAI-compatible VLM endpoint** — the video can come
straight from the user (a local file inlined as base64, or a URL the VLM fetches). VSS
**VST/VIOS is optional**: when it is available the skill can resolve a recorded clip URL
from a named sensor, but it is never required.

> **Hard rule — never call `/generate`.** Every question, including **temporal /
> timing ones** ("at what timestamp did X happen", "how long", "when does Y start"),
> is answered by a single **`POST {VLM_ENDPOINT}/v1/chat/completions`** call built in
> Step 3. Do **not** `POST` to `http://<host>:8000/generate` (the VSS agent's summarize
> pipeline) or `/v1/summarize` under any circumstances — a timestamp question does **not**
> mean you should switch to the summarization pipeline; ask the VLM directly and read the
> timing out of its answer.

---

## Agent harness

**Harness-agnostic** — whatever runs it (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or the NAT VSS Agent) calls
the VLM REST API directly. A running `vss-agent` is optional: Step 2 auto-discovers the VLM from
it, or you pass `VLM_ENDPOINT` / `VLM_MODEL` yourself.

---

## When to Use

- The user asks **what happens in the video**, what **objects / people / actions** appear,
  **colors**, **timing**, **safety**, or other **visual facts** that require watching the clip.
- The user asks for **details** that **cannot be answered** from existing messages, summaries,
  Elasticsearch/MCP results, or filenames alone—you need **model inference on the video**.
- Follow-up questions about **content details** after a coarse summary or after report generation.
- `vss-search-archive` has already displayed only `unverified` results, the user
  explicitly confirmed visual verification, and the caller supplies one exact
  bounded clip as `VIDEO_URL`. Treat that URL as Path A; do not rerun search or
  resolve a different interval.

---

## Negative Triggers

Do **not** use this skill when the request is one of the following:

- A **database / MCP / prior tool output** already answers the question, unless
  the user explicitly wants fresh visual verification. The confirmed bounded
  `vss-search-archive` handoff above is the only search-result exception; use
  `/vss-query-analytics` for analytics-result verification.
- Archive/semantic similarity retrieval ("find forklifts", "search all videos for tailgating")
  → use `/vss-search-archive`. This skill may inspect only the pre-resolved
  bounded clip that search hands off after confirmation; it never performs the
  retrieval itself.
- A request for a **formatted/structured report** ("generate a report", "analysis report")
  → use `/vss-generate-video-report`.
- Summarizing a long recording → use `/vss-summarize-video`.
- Deploy/teardown/profile changes → use `/vss-deploy-profile`.

---

## Instructions

1. **Verify prerequisites** — a reachable VLM endpoint (the only hard requirement) and a
   video to ask about. No specific VSS profile is required, and VST/VIOS is optional
   (see *Prerequisites*).
2. **Run the numbered steps** — *Step 1* (obtain the video — directly from the user, or
   optionally a clip URL from VST/VIOS) → *Step 2* (VLM endpoint/model) → *Step 3* (upload
   the video in the format the target VLM requires and ask the user's question) →
   *Step 4* (return the answer).
3. **Return only the final answer text** to the user (strip any `<think>…</think>` block).

For a confirmed search-result handoff, use only the caller-supplied `VIDEO_URL`
and visual question. Do not consume similarity scores, filenames, object IDs,
or other retrieval metadata as visual evidence, and do not rerun search,
resolve a sensor, broaden the clip, or choose another interval. The caller owns
verdict validation and any fallback after this skill returns. When that question
requests a structured JSON contract, return the response text exactly after
removing hidden reasoning. Do not add a model name, endpoint, VLM/backend label,
sensor or stream ID, UUID, URL, request/retry count, operational summary, or
additional JSON fields.

### Confirmed search-result single-attempt override

For that handoff, complete endpoint/model/media-format selection using read-only
probes before inference, then freeze those choices. Prefer an explicit
`VLM_ENDPOINT`/`VLM_MODEL`; otherwise, when `VLM_REMOTE_URL` and
`VLM_REMOTE_MODEL` are both set and its authenticated `/models` probe lists the
model, use that configured remote endpoint before a proxy. Issue exactly one
`chat/completions` POST. Do not respond to an HTTP/auth/media/model failure by
changing endpoint, model, URL, upload format, credentials, or payload and
posting again; return a technical failure to the caller. Only a 2xx response
whose answer is malformed against the requested JSON contract permits one
repair POST, using the same frozen endpoint, model, clip, and upload format.
Never retry a semantic `confirmed`, `rejected`, or `unverified` result, and stop
after the repair response whether it succeeds or fails.

---

## Prerequisites

No specific VSS profile is required, and VST/VIOS is optional — the skill runs against whatever is
already serving. At runtime it needs:

1. **A reachable OpenAI-compatible VLM `chat/completions` endpoint** *(the only hard requirement)*
   — NIM Cosmos, RT-VLM, or any other. Set `VLM_ENDPOINT` / `VLM_MODEL` directly, or let Step 2
   discover one (and, failing that, deploy a local RT-VLM via `/vss-deploy-dense-captioning`).
2. **A video** — either provided directly (local file → base64, or URL → `video_url`; Step 1
   Path A), or resolved from a VST/VIOS sensor *(optional)* (Step 1 Path B).

### Endpoint resolution (Kubernetes vs Docker)

Resolve public endpoints once when operating against a deployed VSS stack. Follow
[`../vss-build-vision-agent/references/deployment_resolution.md`](../vss-build-vision-agent/references/deployment_resolution.md).
`VSS_ENDPOINT` is accepted as a legacy alias for `VSS_PUBLIC_URL`.

```bash
# Prefer VSS_PUBLIC_URL; accept legacy VSS_ENDPOINT as the same public Ingress origin.
if [ -z "${VSS_PUBLIC_URL:-}" ] && [ -n "${VSS_ENDPOINT:-}" ]; then
  VSS_PUBLIC_URL="${VSS_ENDPOINT}"
fi

if [ -n "${VSS_PUBLIC_URL:-}" ]; then
  DEPLOYMENT_KIND="kubernetes"
  VSS_PUBLIC_URL="${VSS_PUBLIC_URL%/}"
  VSS_VIOS_URL="${VSS_PUBLIC_URL}/vst"
  VST_API_BASE="${VSS_VIOS_URL}/api/v1"
  # Step 2 probes the public /v1 route before adopting it as VLM_ENDPOINT.
else
  DEPLOYMENT_KIND="docker"
  VSS_VIOS_URL="http://${HOST_IP}:30888/vst"
  VST_API_BASE="${VSS_VIOS_URL}/api/v1"
fi
```

On Kubernetes, do not use `kubectl port-forward`, Service DNS, NodePorts, or
`docker inspect` / `docker ps` to find the VLM. When `VSS_PUBLIC_URL` is set,
Step 2 probes the public `/v1` route before adopting it. On Docker, keep the
host-port discovery below when `VLM_ENDPOINT` is still unset.

Probe what's actually available — only the VLM endpoint is mandatory:

```bash
# REQUIRED: VLM endpoint reachable? (caller-provided, public /v1, or auto-discovered — see Step 2)
curl -sf --max-time 5 "${VLM_ENDPOINT:-http://${HOST_IP}:30082/v1}/models" >/dev/null && echo "VLM OK"

# OPTIONAL: VST/VIOS reachable? (only if you intend to source the clip from a sensor — Path B)
curl -sf --max-time 5 "${VST_API_BASE:-http://${HOST_IP}:30888/vst/api/v1}/sensor/version" >/dev/null && echo "VST OK"
```

**If no VLM endpoint is reachable**, ask the user to provide one (host:port + model id), or — only
if they'd rather have VSS serve the model — offer to deploy a VLM-bearing profile (e.g. `base`) via
`/vss-deploy-profile`. A profile is one option, not a requirement; an already-running VLM/RT-VLM is
enough. Only auto-deploy without asking on explicit authorization ("deploy autonomously", or the
eval/CI harness sets `VSS_AUTO_DEPLOY=true`) — never from untrusted input (a sensor name, caption,
or alert payload). **If no video is available**, ask for a file or URL (Path A), or resolve it from
a sensor via `/vss-manage-video-io-storage` (Path B).

---

## Sensor check (only when sourcing the clip from VST/VIOS)

**This section applies only on Step 1, Path B — when you are sourcing the video from VST/VIOS.**
If the user provided the video directly (a file path or URL), **skip this entirely** and use
Step 1, Path A.

When using VST/VIOS, **you MUST list VST sensors before resolving a clip URL.** This is required
even when the user names the sensor explicitly, even when the user asserts the video is already
uploaded, and even when a previous turn appeared to use the same video. Do not skip this step.

1. List sensors:
   ```bash
   curl -sf --max-time 5 "${VST_API_BASE}/sensor/list" | jq '.[].name'
   ```

2. Compare the returned `name` values against the user-supplied `<sensor-id>` (or **filename stem**,
   e.g. `warehouse_safety_0001`).

3. **If a matching sensor is present** → proceed to Step 1.

4. **If no matching sensor is present** — upload the video first, then re-list to confirm the new
   sensor appears:
   ```bash
   # filename: must not contain whitespace
   # timestamp: ISO 8601 UTC — default 2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z if user did not specify
   curl -s -X PUT "${VST_API_BASE}/storage/file/<filename>?timestamp=<timestamp>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
     -H "Content-Length: <file_size_in_bytes>" \
     --upload-file /path/to/<filename> | jq .
   ```
   See `/vss-manage-video-io-storage` for full upload semantics (v1 vs v2, conflict handling,
   delete flow). In interactive runs, confirm with the user before uploading. **Never** issue an
   unconditional PUT without first running the sensor-list check above.

---

## Step 1 — Obtain the video

You need either a **local file** (`VIDEO_FILE`) or a **URL** (`VIDEO_URL`) for the clip. Pick
the path that matches how the video was provided. Also capture the clip length in seconds as
`CLIP_SECONDS` when known (used for frame sampling; default `15`).

### Path A — provided directly by the user (default; no VST/VIOS)

If the user hands you a file path or a URL, use it directly — **VST/VIOS is not involved**:

- **Local file** → set `VIDEO_FILE=/path/to/clip.mp4`. Step 3 inlines it as a base64 video block
  (`file_base64`) so the VLM ingests the video directly. Nothing is downloaded.
- **URL the VLM can fetch** → set `VIDEO_URL=<url>`. Step 3 sends it as a `video_url` block; if the
  VLM is remote and can't reach the URL, inline it instead (`file_base64`).

A user-confirmed search-result handoff with a pre-resolved bounded `VIDEO_URL`
uses this same path. Do not discard that URL and enter Path B merely because
the caller also retains a sensor ID or timestamps for reporting.

Then go straight to Step 2 — **skip the Sensor check**.

### Path B — resolve from VST/VIOS (optional)

> **Hard rule — a question that names a sensor is Path B, and the clip URL MUST come from VST.**
> When the question references a VST sensor/`streamId` (e.g. `warehouse_safety_0001`), obtain the
> clip via the `/url` GET below and bind its `videoUrl` to `VIDEO_URL` — **even if a local copy of
> the same video exists**. Do **not** skip this by inlining that copy as base64 — that bypasses VST.
> Inlining is allowed only for a genuinely remote VLM, and only by downloading *that* `videoUrl`.
> Applies even to temporal questions ("at what timestamp…").

When the clip lives on a named sensor, hand off to `/vss-manage-video-io-storage`: confirm the
named `<sensor-id>` exists (the *Sensor check* above — required on this path), then run the block
below **verbatim**. It reads the recorded range from `/timelines` and passes it to `/url` in one
go, so the two required parameters cannot be dropped or invented: a bare `/url` returns an **empty
body**, and a window that is not in the recording returns `VMSNoDataError`.

```bash
SENSOR_NAME='<the sensor id / filename stem the question named>'
_VST="${VST_API_BASE:-http://${HOST_IP}:30888/vst/api/v1}"
# Resolve the streamId every time — a later question is a fresh run with no STREAM_ID in hand, and
# sensor/list carries sensorId + name but NOT streamId, so read it from the sensor's streams.
if [ -z "${STREAM_ID:-}" ]; then
  _SID="$(curl -sf "${_VST}/sensor/list" | jq -r --arg n "$SENSOR_NAME" 'map(select(.name==$n))[0].sensorId // empty' 2>/dev/null)"
  [ -n "$_SID" ] || { echo "no sensor named '${SENSOR_NAME}' — upload it first (Sensor check), do NOT answer from a local copy"; exit 1; }
  STREAM_ID="$(curl -sf "${_VST}/sensor/${_SID}/streams" | jq -r '(if type=="array" then (map(select(.isMain)) + .)[0].streamId else .streamId end) // empty' 2>/dev/null)"
  [ -n "$STREAM_ID" ] || { echo "sensor '${SENSOR_NAME}' has no stream, do NOT answer from a local copy"; exit 1; }
fi
for _ in $(seq 1 15); do          # timelines populate asynchronously after an upload
  TL="$(curl -sf "${_VST}/storage/${STREAM_ID}/timelines" || echo '')"
  [ "$(printf '%s' "${TL:-[]}" | jq -r 'if type=="array" then length else 0 end' 2>/dev/null)" -gt 0 ] && break
  sleep 2
done
# Take BOTH ends from one segment: /url rejects a window that spans a gap (VMSInternalError).
START="$(printf '%s' "${TL:-[]}" | jq -r 'sort_by(.startTime)|.[0].startTime // empty' 2>/dev/null)"
END="$(printf '%s' "${TL:-[]}" | jq -r 'sort_by(.startTime)|.[0].endTime // empty' 2>/dev/null)"
[ -n "$START" ] && [ -n "$END" ] || { echo "no VST timeline for ${STREAM_ID} — do NOT guess a window and do NOT answer from a local copy"; exit 1; }
VIDEO_URL="$(curl -sf "${_VST}/storage/file/${STREAM_ID}/url?startTime=${START}&endTime=${END}&container=mp4&disableAudio=true" | jq -r '.videoUrl // empty')"
[ -n "$VIDEO_URL" ] || { echo "empty videoUrl — do NOT fall back to base64/local file on Path B"; exit 1; }
# VIOS /url may hand back a doubled scheme, a bare /storage path, or a localhost host that does not
# reach VST from inside the VLM's container. Reduce to a path and restore the VIOS route — the same
# compat mapping /vss-generate-video-report applies, so this holds on Kubernetes and Docker alike.
CLIP_PATH="${VIDEO_URL#*://}"; CLIP_PATH="${CLIP_PATH#*://}"
case "$CLIP_PATH" in /*) ;; *) CLIP_PATH="/${CLIP_PATH#*/}" ;; esac
VIDEO_URL="${VSS_VIOS_URL:-http://${HOST_IP}:30888/vst}${CLIP_PATH#/vst}"
for _ in 1 2 3; do curl -sf -o /dev/null --max-time 60 "$VIDEO_URL" && break || sleep 3; done  # warm the lazy render (GET; HEAD 404s)
VST_SOURCED=1                     # marks this run as Path B
CLIP_SECONDS="${CLIP_SECONDS:-15}"   # endTime − startTime; default 15
```

Whether the VLM consumes `VIDEO_URL` as-is or needs the bytes uploaded inline depends on the
target VLM — **Step 3 picks the right upload format**. A **local / in-cluster** VLM can usually
fetch `VIDEO_URL` directly; a **remote** VLM generally cannot reach `localhost`, a private
`HOST_IP`, or VST-internal URLs, so Step 3 downloads the clip and sends it inline (full-file
base64). A user-supplied `VIDEO_FILE` (Path A) is always inlined — there is no URL to fetch.

---

## Step 2 — Resolve the VLM endpoint and model

For a confirmed search-result handoff, first adopt a configured direct remote
endpoint when it is fully specified and its read-only authenticated probe
succeeds. This selection happens before, and does not count as, the one allowed
inference request:

```bash
if [ -z "${VLM_ENDPOINT:-}" ] && [ -n "${VLM_REMOTE_URL:-}" ] && [ -n "${VLM_REMOTE_MODEL:-}" ]; then
  _remote_endpoint="${VLM_REMOTE_URL%/}"
  case "${_remote_endpoint}" in */v1) ;; *) _remote_endpoint="${_remote_endpoint}/v1" ;; esac
  _remote_models=$(curl -fsS --connect-timeout 5 --max-time 15 \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${NVIDIA_API_KEY:?NVIDIA_API_KEY is required for VLM_REMOTE_URL}" \
    "${_remote_endpoint}/models") || exit 1
  printf '%s' "${_remote_models}" | jq -e --arg model "${VLM_REMOTE_MODEL}" \
    '.data | any(.id == $model)' >/dev/null || exit 1
  VLM_ENDPOINT="${_remote_endpoint}"
  VLM_MODEL="${VLM_REMOTE_MODEL}"
  case "${VLM_MODEL}" in *cosmos*) VLM_BACKEND="nim_cosmos" ;; *) VLM_BACKEND="rtvlm" ;; esac
fi
```

If the caller already provides a VLM endpoint, use it directly — this skill only requires a
reachable OpenAI-compatible `chat/completions` endpoint:

```bash
# Caller-provided (preferred when the full agent stack is not deployed):
#   VLM_ENDPOINT  e.g. http://${HOST_IP}:30082/v1   (must end in /v1)
#   VLM_MODEL     e.g. nvidia/cosmos-reason1-7b
```

Or, when only a **deployed VSS** is reachable (you have its **public URL**, not the VLM's own
port), route through the public Ingress VLM path. Stock **base** Helm exposes RT-VLM under
`${VSS_PUBLIC_URL}/v1` (OpenAI-compatible root ending in `/v1`). Do **not** use `/vlm/v1` —
that path is not present on current base Ingress or Docker HAProxy:

```bash
# Prefer VSS_PUBLIC_URL; VSS_ENDPOINT is a legacy alias for the same origin.
if [ -z "${VSS_PUBLIC_URL:-}" ] && [ -n "${VSS_ENDPOINT:-}" ]; then
  VSS_PUBLIC_URL="${VSS_ENDPOINT}"
fi
if [ -z "${VLM_ENDPOINT:-}" ] && [ -n "${VSS_PUBLIC_URL:-}" ]; then
  _proxy="${VSS_PUBLIC_URL%/}/v1"                   # base Ingress RT-VLM route
  if _models=$(curl -sf --max-time 5 "${_proxy}/models") \
    && _model=$(printf '%s' "${_models}" | jq -r '.data[0].id // empty') \
    && [ -n "${_model}" ]; then
    VLM_ENDPOINT="${_proxy}"
    VLM_MODEL="${VLM_MODEL:-${_model}}"
    # If the VLM is token-gated behind the proxy, add: -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
  fi
fi
```

Otherwise, on **Docker only** (`DEPLOYMENT_KIND=docker` or `VSS_PUBLIC_URL` unset),
auto-discover the live endpoint from the running `vss-agent` container. The deploy may
serve the VLM through either of two OpenAI-compatible stacks — read the live values, do not guess.
Skip this block on Kubernetes: there is no host-side Docker socket requirement, and private
service ports must not be port-forwarded.

Read the agent's env with `docker inspect`, **not** `docker exec`: the `vss-agent` image is
distroless (no `sh`/`bash`/`printenv` on `PATH`), so `docker exec vss-agent sh -lc …` fails with
`exec: "sh": executable file not found`. `docker inspect` reads the configured env without a shell:

```bash
# Docker only — when an agent is actually running; otherwise supply VLM_ENDPOINT/VLM_MODEL directly.
# Assign into a fixed whitelist of vars WITHOUT eval, so a hostile or malformed env value
# (e.g. VLM_NAME='x; rm -rf /') is always treated as data and never executed.
if [ "${DEPLOYMENT_KIND:-docker}" != "kubernetes" ] && docker ps --format '{{.Names}}' | grep -qx vss-agent; then
  while IFS='=' read -r _k _v; do
    case "$_k" in
      HOST_IP|VLM_MODE|VLM_MODEL_TYPE|VLM_BASE_URL|VLM_NAME|RTVI_VLM_BASE_URL)
        printf -v "$_k" '%s' "$_v"; export "$_k" ;;
    esac
  done < <(docker inspect vss-agent --format '{{range .Config.Env}}{{println .}}{{end}}')
fi
```

Selection rule (only when `VLM_ENDPOINT` is not already set — Docker host discovery):

```bash
if [ -z "${VLM_ENDPOINT:-}" ] && [ "${DEPLOYMENT_KIND:-docker}" != "kubernetes" ]; then
  if [ "${VLM_MODEL_TYPE:-}" = "rtvi" ]; then
    # RT-VLM (lvs / alerts). The API model id is VLM_NAME (e.g. nim_nvidia_cosmos-reason2-8b_hf-1208)
    # — it matches RT-VLM's /v1/models and is what the agent itself uses (config rtvi_vlm.model_name:
    # ${VLM_NAME}). We deliberately do NOT read RTVI_VLM_MODEL_TO_USE: it is an RT-VLM *backend
    # selector* (e.g. "cosmos-reason2"), not an API model id, and it is not exposed on the
    # vss-agent container. If VLM_NAME is empty the /v1/models guard below resolves the real id.
    VLM_BACKEND="rtvlm"
    VLM_ENDPOINT="${RTVI_VLM_BASE_URL:+${RTVI_VLM_BASE_URL%/}/v1}"
    [ -z "${VLM_ENDPOINT}" ] && [ -n "${VLM_BASE_URL:-}" ] && VLM_ENDPOINT="${VLM_BASE_URL%/}/v1"
    [ -z "${VLM_ENDPOINT}" ] && VLM_ENDPOINT="http://${HOST_IP}:8018/v1"   # lvs/alerts default
    VLM_MODEL="${VLM_NAME:-}"
  elif [ -n "${VLM_BASE_URL:-}" ] && [ "${VLM_MODE:-}" != "none" ]; then
    VLM_BACKEND="nim_cosmos"
    VLM_ENDPOINT="${VLM_BASE_URL%/}/v1"
    VLM_MODEL="${VLM_NAME:-}"
  else
    # Fallback discovery: set VLM_BACKEND to match the endpoint we actually resolve, so the
    # nim_cosmos mm_processor_kwargs step below fires when we land on a NIM Cosmos endpoint.
    if [ -n "${RTVI_VLM_BASE_URL:-}" ]; then
      VLM_BACKEND="rtvlm"
      VLM_ENDPOINT="${RTVI_VLM_BASE_URL%/}/v1"
      VLM_MODEL="${VLM_NAME:-}"
    elif [ -n "${VLM_BASE_URL:-}" ]; then
      VLM_BACKEND="nim_cosmos"
      VLM_ENDPOINT="${VLM_BASE_URL%/}/v1"
      VLM_MODEL="${VLM_NAME:-}"
    else
      VLM_BACKEND="nim_cosmos"
      VLM_ENDPOINT="http://${HOST_IP}:30082/v1"  # base default (NIM Cosmos)
      VLM_MODEL="${VLM_NAME:-}"
    fi
  fi
fi

# Never proceed with an empty model id (e.g. nim_cosmos when VLM_NAME was unset, or a
# caller who supplied VLM_ENDPOINT but not VLM_MODEL): adopt the first id the endpoint
# actually serves, then hard-fail if it is still empty rather than sending model="".
if [ -z "${VLM_MODEL:-}" ] && [ -n "${VLM_ENDPOINT:-}" ]; then
  VLM_MODEL="$(curl -sf --max-time 5 "${VLM_ENDPOINT}/models" | jq -r '.data[0].id // empty')"
fi
[ -n "${VLM_MODEL:-}" ] || { echo "Could not resolve a VLM model id for ${VLM_ENDPOINT:-<unset>}; set VLM_MODEL explicitly"; exit 1; }
```

Probe `/v1/models` before sending a chat request to confirm the endpoint is alive and the model
is loaded:

```bash
curl -sf --max-time 5 "${VLM_ENDPOINT}/models" | jq -r '.data[].id'
```

If the probe fails or the listed ids don't include `${VLM_MODEL}`, fall back to the other backend
only before any `chat/completions` POST. The confirmed search-result override forbids fallback
after its first inference request.
If **no** endpoint resolves at all (nothing reachable), there is no default VLM selection in
place — follow *No default VLM selection?* below instead of silently failing.

### No default VLM selection? Discover first, then prompt (VIA-E-114-04)

Discovery above always runs **first** — an explicit `VLM_ENDPOINT`, then a deployed VSS via its
public URL (`VSS_PUBLIC_URL` / legacy `VSS_ENDPOINT` → Ingress `${origin}/v1`), then — on Docker
only — the running `vss-agent` env and default ports (`:30082` NIM / `:8018` RT-VLM), each
confirmed live with `/v1/models`. When that yields a reachable endpoint, use it and continue to
Step 3 — **do not prompt**.

Only when **no** endpoint resolves (no default selection is in place) prompt the user for how to
supply a VLM (HITL-optional — see the non-interactive default below). Offer three choices:

1. **Provide a VLM endpoint** — take `VLM_ENDPOINT` (+ optional `VLM_MODEL`), then re-probe
   `/v1/models` and continue.
2. **Provide a deployed VSS public URL** — take `VSS_PUBLIC_URL` (or legacy `VSS_ENDPOINT`);
   resolve the VLM through `${VSS_PUBLIC_URL%/}/v1`, confirm with `/v1/models`, then continue.
   Use this when the VLM/RT-VLM port isn't directly reachable but the VSS Ingress is. Do **not**
   probe `/vlm/v1`.
3. **Pick a discovered suggestion** — list any endpoints that responded (the public `/v1`
   proxy, the `vss-agent` env on Docker, or the default `:30082` / `:8018` ports) and let the
   user choose one.
4. **Deploy a local RT-VLM** — hand off to
   [`/vss-deploy-dense-captioning`](../vss-deploy-dense-captioning/SKILL.md) (default model
   **cosmos-reason2-8b**, profile `bp_developer_alerts_2d_vlm`; this tracks the RT-VLM deploy
   default — cosmos-reason2 today, cosmos-reason3 once 3.2.1 ships), then resume against the
   **live** service — never a hardcoded endpoint/model:

   ```bash
   VLM_ENDPOINT="http://${HOST_IP}:${RTVI_VLM_PORT:-8018}/v1"   # matches the RT-VLM deploy contract
   curl -sf --max-time 5 "${VLM_ENDPOINT}/health/ready"          # first boot can take ~20 min
   # Resolve the model id from the endpoint — the cosmos-reason2 name is a backend selector,
   # NOT an API model id, so read the real id the server advertises:
   VLM_MODEL="$(curl -sf --max-time 5 "${VLM_ENDPOINT}/models" | jq -r '.data[0].id // empty')"
   VLM_BACKEND="rtvlm"
   # If the deployed RT-VLM is token-gated, add the bearer on every request:
   #   -H "Authorization: Bearer ${RTVI_VLM_API_KEY:-${NGC_CLI_API_KEY:-}}"
   ```

**Non-interactive / HITL-disabled (CI, headless agents):** do not block on a prompt. If a
discovered endpoint already exists, use it; otherwise the default action is to **deploy a local
RT-VLM** (option 4) and continue. Hard-fail only when a deploy is impossible (no GPU or no
`NGC_CLI_API_KEY`), printing the options above so the caller can set `VLM_ENDPOINT` /
`VSS_PUBLIC_URL`.

## Step 3 — Upload the clip in the target VLM's format and ask the question

Send the **user's question** (not a fixed prompt) to the OpenAI-compatible `chat/completions`
endpoint — but **upload the clip in the format the target VLM/microservice requires**, the same
way the agent's `video_understanding` tool does (`src/vss_agents/tools/video_understanding.py`,
`_build_vlm_messages`). There is no one-size-fits-all payload:

**The input you have decides the block** — there's no priority to agonize over; all three work
if the VLM supports them:

| `UPLOAD_FORMAT` | What it sends | Use when the input is… |
|---|---|---|
| `video_url` | a `video_url` block with the URL (the VLM fetches it) | a **URL** the VLM can reach (a VST clip URL, or a user-supplied URL) |
| `file_base64` | the MP4 inlined as a `data:video/mp4;base64,…` URI | a **local file** (or already-base64 data) — the VLM ingests the video directly |

So: URL → `video_url`; local file / base64 → `file_base64`. Use `file_base64` (not `video_url`)
whenever the VLM can't fetch the URL — a **remote** VLM that can't reach a `localhost`/internal
`VIDEO_URL`. Mind the RT-VLM inline-base64 cap: `nim_compat.py max_length=10000000` limits the
base64 **string** to 10M characters, which — since base64 adds ~33% — means a raw clip of only
**~7.5 MB** (a 10 MB MP4 base64-encodes to ~13.3M chars and is rejected). Set
`UPLOAD_FORMAT` to force either one.

> **VST-sourced (Path B) ⇒ `video_url`.** Use the VST `videoUrl` (in `VIDEO_URL`) as a `video_url`
> block — an in-cluster VLM (incl. base NIM Cosmos) can fetch the `localhost:30888` URL. Never
> inline a stray local copy as `file_base64`; do that only for a genuinely remote VLM, and only by
> downloading *that* `videoUrl`. Applies to temporal questions too. (Enforced by the guard below.)

On a NIM Cosmos **video block** — *both* the `video_url` path and the `file_base64` data-URI
path — also send `mm_processor_kwargs` / `media_io_kwargs` to match the agent's frame-sampling and
visual-token budget. This is **required**, not optional: without `media_io_kwargs.num_frames` the
NIM under-samples the inline MP4 and can return a confident but wrong description (verified against
`cosmos-reason2-8b`). Read the live `video_understanding` settings if the `vss-agent` container is
up, else use the documented defaults.

> **Which backend is this?** Any model id containing `cosmos` reached as a **direct/base NIM**
> endpoint is NIM Cosmos and needs these fields. An `nim_nvidia_…_bf16` / `_hf`-style id (e.g.
> `nim_nvidia_cosmos3-nano-reasoner_bf16-final`) does **not** make it RT-VLM: RT-VLM is decided by
> discovery (`VLM_MODEL_TYPE=rtvi`, or the `:8018` port), never by the model name. RT-VLM genuinely
> does not need them — it preprocesses server-side.
>
> **Run the `curl` below verbatim rather than hand-writing your own**, and answer a second or
> follow-up question by re-running the same block with a new `USER_QUESTION` / `UPLOAD_FORMAT`.
> Hand-built requests keep omitting these fields on the `video_url` path. If you must construct one
> yourself, pick the shape matching the model and always include the `num_frames` entry:
>
> ```json
> "mm_processor_kwargs": {"size": {"shortest_edge": 3136, "longest_edge": 8388608}}      // cosmos-reason2
> "mm_processor_kwargs": {"videos_kwargs": {"min_pixels": 3136, "max_pixels": 8388608}}  // other cosmos (reason1, reason3/cosmos3)
> "media_io_kwargs": {"video": {"num_frames": <NUM_FRAMES>}}                             // both shapes

## Step 4 — Return the answer

Return only the VLM's answer text to the user.

- If the response contains a `<think>…</think>` block (Cosmos Reason reasoning mode), keep only
  the text after `</think>`.
- Do not wrap the answer in a report template — this skill returns the plain answer (light
  markdown is fine).
- For a confirmed search-result handoff requesting JSON, return only that JSON
  object. Do not wrap, explain, summarize, enrich, or report how it was produced.
- If that handoff ends in a technical failure, say only that verification of
  the bounded clip is unavailable due to a technical service failure. Do not
  mention a VLM, model, endpoint, API, request, retry, credential, or backend.

---

## Examples

- "What's happening in this clip? `/home/me/forklift.mp4`" → **no VST/VIOS**: set
  `VIDEO_FILE`, inline it as a base64 video block (Path A), call the VLM, return the answer.
- "Is the worker wearing PPE? `https://example.com/clip.mp4`" → set `VIDEO_URL` (Path A); a
  local VLM fetches it directly, a remote VLM gets it inlined.
- "Is the worker in `warehouse_safety_0001` wearing PPE?" → sensor name → VST/VIOS (Path B):
  resolve clip URL, call the VLM, return the answer.
- "At what timestamp did the worker climb the ladder?" → same VST path; the answer includes a timestamp.
- "What color is the truck at 00:12 in `dock_cam`?" → VST path; resolve the segment around 00:12, call the VLM.

---

## Error Handling

- If a probe, `curl`, or VLM call fails, stop and report the failing endpoint, HTTP status or
  command error, and the next useful recovery step. Do not fabricate an answer.
- If **no video is available** (neither `VIDEO_FILE` nor `VIDEO_URL`, and no sensor to resolve),
  stop and ask the user for a file or URL — do not call the VLM without a video.
- If `UPLOAD_FORMAT=video_url` but only a local `VIDEO_FILE` was provided, switch to
  `file_base64` — there is no URL for the VLM to fetch.
- If `/v1/models` succeeds but `${VLM_MODEL}` is not listed, fall back to the other backend or
  surface the mismatch — never send a chat request for a model the server has not loaded.
- If the VLM endpoint is **remote** and `VIDEO_URL` is a `localhost` / private-`HOST_IP` /
  VST-internal URL, do **not** send a `video_url` block — Step 3 inlines the media instead
  (`UPLOAD_FORMAT=file_base64`). Only surface an error if the inline upload itself fails
  (download error, `base64` missing, or payload rejected as too large).
- If the VLM response is empty, malformed, or contains only a reasoning block, surface that
  response problem and suggest checking model readiness/logs before retrying.

## Cross-Reference

- **`/vss-manage-video-io-storage`** — *optional* (Step 1, Path B): sensor list, timelines, and
  the clip URL when sourcing the video from VST/VIOS. Not needed when the user supplies the video.
- **`/vss-deploy-dense-captioning`** — *optional* (Step 2): stand up a standalone **RT-VLM**
  endpoint on a local GPU when no VLM is reachable, then point this skill at it
  (`http://${HOST_IP}:${RTVI_VLM_PORT:-8018}/v1`, model resolved from `/v1/models`).
- **`/vss-generate-video-report`** — timestamped **reports** via Mode A (the same direct-VLM
  mechanism) or Mode B (video-analytics incidents); this skill returns an ad-hoc **answer**, not a report.
- **`/vss-query-analytics`** — read already-computed incidents/metrics (no live VLM inference).
