"""VSS <-> OpenClaw agent adapter (POC).

Exposes an OpenAI-shaped streaming chat endpoint that the VSS UI can point at
via NEXT_PUBLIC_SIDEBAR_CHAT_HTTP_CHAT_COMPLETION_URL, and drives an OpenClaw
gateway over its WebSocket protocol (v4).

  POST /chat/stream   {"messages":[...]}  -> text/event-stream
  GET  /health

Gateway protocol notes (discovered empirically against OpenClaw 2026.6.10):
  - server opens with event connect.challenge (nonce is NOT echoed back)
  - connect params: omit `device` entirely to skip device-identity/pairing
  - scopes must be named explicitly; "*" is rejected
  - sessions.messages.subscribe takes {"key": ...}, chat.send takes
    {"sessionKey", "message", "idempotencyKey"}
